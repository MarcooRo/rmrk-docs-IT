title: "NFT Evolution"

This is an example of [Ownership of Experience](/ownershipxp).

With last-gen NFT technology, replacing an NFT to evolve or change it requires either centralized
metadata, or a burn-and-mint mechanic.

With RMRK's [Multi-Asset NFTs](/lego2-multi-resource), this is easier.

If an asset is added to an NFT with an extra argument provided targeting an existing asset by asset
ID, that targeted asset will be **replaced**.

This makes for good _evolution_ mechanics where an NFT can grow or change over time. E.g. a tree
that grows from seed, to sapling, to young tree, to mature tree. Additionally, assuming the tree NFT
needed to be watered with ðŸ’¦ emoji every week or else it would die, it is possible that yet another
asset could represent a tree's death stage.

Each stage of its growth is a new asset, replacing the previous one.

This is also useful in games. Imagine Pikachu evolving into Raichu by just having a asset replaced
in a fully decentralized way, no single point of failure in between.
