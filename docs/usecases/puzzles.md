Using [equipping logic](/lego25-equippable) and [multi asset NFTs](/lego2-multi-resource), one could
create a puzzle NFT with specific slots for puzzle-pieces.

Collectors would then need to collect these pieces - either through some contests, random draws,
treasure hunts, or even purely secondary purchases - and equip the parts into their puzzle.

Similar projects already exist:

- [Proof of Chaos](https://proofofchaos.app/)
- [Ukraine Relief Stamp Album](https://twitter.com/StampForUkraine)

An advanced version of this approach is a remake of the popular "one million dollar" website, or
BAYC graffiti wall - one could make a single puzzle NFT into which others could _guest-equip_ (a new
RMRK functionality for temporary nesting) their pieces. This would allow for an interesting contest
and collaborative experience in composing a single multi-user graphic wall, or could even expand to
other media, like [collaborative music compositions](/usecases/collabmusic).

The original issuer of the parent NFT could then choose to "seal" the state of the wall at a certain
point in time, disallowing withdrawals of the guest NFTs and finalizing the pieces into a piece of
collaborative art.
