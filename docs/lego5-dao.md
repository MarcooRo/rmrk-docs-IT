title: "NFTs as DAOs"
---

Being able to turn an NFT into a DAO refers to the ability of RMRK NFTs to be fractionalized for a deposit in [RMRK tokens](https://singular.app/tokens).

These share tokens can then be used to collectively issue commands to an NFT. This video demonstrates one of the potential use cases:

Another possible use case is a collective gaming experience where a Twitch streamer tokenizes an in-game avatar and distributes the tokens live to their community to participate in in-game decision making during the game.

Alternatively, it can also be used for partial ownership of high-value NFTs.
