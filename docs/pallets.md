title: FRAME implementaton
---

This is one of two versions of the so called "RMRK 3" - an implementation of the specification in the Rust language, using Parity's FRAME pallet system meant for integration with the [Substrate](https://substrate.io) framework. This makes RMRK compatible with Substrate-based blockchains like Acala, Subsocial, Zeitgeist, and others.

The FRAME pallets implementation can be found at https://github.com/rmrk-team/rmrk-substrate. Usage tutorials are coming soon.

To explore each individual [concept](/concepts), please see the applicable pallets linked below:

- [RMRK soulbound 2.0](https://github.com/rmrk-team/rmrk-substrate/blob/main/pallets/rmrk-core/src/lib.rs)
- [RMRK equippables](https://github.com/rmrk-team/rmrk-substrate/tree/main/pallets/rmrk-equip)
