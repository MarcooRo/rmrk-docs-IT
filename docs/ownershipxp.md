title: Ownership of Experience

In current metaverse projects, most experience is stored on a centralized server: your level progress, skills, even resources gathered. In most cases, even projects advertising equippables use just a centralize database to pretend it's NFT equipment, misleading their community.

If this server goes down - as it inevitably will due to expensive centralized infrastructure and vampire attacks from other projects - so does the experience.

RMRK NFTs enable true Ownership of Experience in that you log out of a game-like experience with a slightly more valuable NFT every time.

Your character can grow and level up over time by collecting [non-transferable](/nontransferable) "experience NFTs", it can keep its accessories and assets _inside_ of itself, and it can be given [new resources](/lego2-multi-resource) over time as it evolves.

This allows an NFT to grow, evolve, and keep growing in value in a decentralized way, to the point of being recognizable as valuable and evolved by any future game or metaverse project.

With RMRK, NFTs become generational wealth through [Evolution](/usecases/evolution) or [Character Progression Systems](/usecases/charprog).
