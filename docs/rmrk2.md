title: RMRK 2.0
---

Building on the [RMRK 1.0 logic](/rmrk1) of interpreting system remarks, RMRK 2.0 adds more
functionality on top.

With RMRK 2 we introduce the concept of _NFT legos_: extremely simple primitive components of a
standard that, when put together, can make an infinitely complex project which is still supported by
any UI supporting the individual standards.

The legos are defined in the [concepts](/concepts).

With this power, we enable the construction of very rich and smart NFT projects without needing
custom logic and smart contracts, dramatically expanding forward compatibility of the NFTs created
this way. 

As an introduction, [this coding workshop](https://crowdcast.io/e/buidl) is a good foray into RMRK
2.0 composability, and its accompanying code repository can be found [here](https://github.com/rmrk-team/rmrk2-examples).
